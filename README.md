# Robust-BET-Dispatching-Dataset

Robust BET Dispatching Problem with Backhauls and Time Windows under Travel Time Uncertainty [dataset]
---

The generated problem instance with 47 customers are based on a real-world dataset, the typical one-day historical movements of a heavy-duty diesel truck fleet that operated in the Riverside and San Bernardino County regions of California.


### Description of the data and file structure

For each generated instance in our case study, it contains cutomers' IDs, as well as information on the delivery types (i.e., pickups and deliveries), required demands [in lbs.], time windows [in minute] and service times [in minute]. 

For each dispatching instance, the distance [in meter] and travel duration [in second] matrices is generated by OpenRouteService (openrouteservice.org) for the truck routes between node-to-node locations, which can be used to estimate the energy consumption and travel time.
